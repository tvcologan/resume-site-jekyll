# Jekyll Resume Theme

A simple Jekyll theme for displaying a resume/cv online.

The theme follows the default Jekyll build as closely as possible to avoid any dependency issues.

To customise you just need to fill out the `_config.yml` and the jobs and education `.yml` files in the `_data` directory with your own details.

Inspired by the theme [here](https://github.com/mattcouchman/jekyll-resume).
